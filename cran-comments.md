## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
* The note is because the package is large. It contains only data to be used with a modeling and simulation package, Pmetrics, which we will submit to CRAN next. However, because Pmetrics will use PmetricsData as a Suggests, PmetricsData needs to be on CRAN first, as we understand it.
* The data can be used in other applications or packages, particularly dealing with drug pharmacokinetics, eg. PKNCA.
