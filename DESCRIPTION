Description: Pmetrics is short for pharmacometrics, the discipline of modeling drug kinetics and effects on biologic systems, including disease progression. Models can be used to simulate novel therapeutic dosing regimens and/or populations, informing trial design and dosing strategies. The PmetricsData package provides the data necessary to run examples and some functions in the parent Pmetrics package. Included are sample data and model, outputs of model fitting and simulation, CDC growth tables, and an example of minimum inhbitory concentration data for an antibiotic/bacterium pair. Datasets can be used in other packages and applications.
